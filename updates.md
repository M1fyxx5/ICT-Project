# Change logging

## Rules on how to write change/update log

1. Write a date in US format e.g. month.date.year
2. User name is required in update entry
3. It is important to mark all Changes/Improvements and Issues
4. If many users did changes in one day, last user should mark his name in the same raw there he wrote what he did
5. Make text easier to read using tags
6. Everything covered in '...' means it was remastered in the same day

## Update 11.26.23 ~ mify

### Improvements

- 'Optimized navigation bar'
- 'Navigation bar is now available on any web-site directory'
- Remastered: Navigation bar it self & remove Drop-Down menu-entries
- **about_us.html** is up & running
- Since now server is running on `http://localhost:3000/`
- Added *logging* in console
- Created **readme.md** created in main directory

### Issues

- Navigation bar's code is repeated in each page file *Memory & readability issue*
- There is no need in index.js file *Requires optimization*
- Inapropriate file locations *Writability issues*
- **Logs** should be stored in additional file *Not that important*
- **readme.md** *must have* filled with contents such as project explanation, roadmap, features that are already *implemented*
