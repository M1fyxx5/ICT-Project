# Change log

## Rules on how to write change/update log

1. Write a date in **US format** e.g. month.date.year
2. User name is required in update entry
3. It is important to mark all Changes/Improvements and Issues
4. If many users did changes in one day, last user should mark his name in the same raw there he wrote what he did
5. Make text easier to read using tags
6. Everything covered in '...' means it was remastered in the same day
